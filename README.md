## FAQ

#### No messages are appearing on my Discord Server

This is most likely caused by you not configuring the Discord Webhook, Instructions on how to do this can be found in the [Configuration](https://github.com/ThatAlbaPerson/AntiAdmin/wiki/Configuration) guide.

#### The /gamemode command won't work for me

In version 1.0.0 the /gamemode command is disabled, In order to change your gamemode you would need to do it through the server console.

#### Colour codes aren't working.
