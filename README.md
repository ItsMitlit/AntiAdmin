# [MC] Anti-Admin

#### AntiAdmin is a Bukkit plugin designed to prevent cheating with admin commands on Minecraft servers. When an admin attempts to use an "admin" command, the plugin sends a notification to a specified Discord channel via a webhook. In addition, the plugin broadcasts a message in chat to alert other players of the attempt.
